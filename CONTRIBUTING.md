# Contributing to MapLibre Native Slint

We welcome contributions to MapLibre Native Slint! Here are some guidelines to follow:

## Getting Started

## Contribution Workflow

1.  **Fork and Clone:** Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your changes.
3.  **Make Changes:** Implement your feature or bug fix.
4.  **Test:** Build the project and run the examples to ensure everything works as expected.
5.  **Submit a Pull Request:** Open a pull request with a clear description of your changes.

## Development

Please follow the existing code style and conventions. Make sure to update the documentation if you introduce new features or change existing behavior.

## No Mapbox Backports

A critical rule is to not backport code from Mapbox projects that was contributed under their new proprietary license. This is to avoid copyright infringement and is considered a significant threat to the MapLibre project. If you have any doubts, it is best to ask for clarification.
